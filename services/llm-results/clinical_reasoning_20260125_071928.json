  "clinical_summary": "On 2025-07-22 laboratory testing revealed markedly elevated conjugated bilirubin (7.79 mg/dL), mildly increased unconjugated bilirubin (1.63 mg/dL), elevated AST (162 U/L) and ALT (86 U/L), markedly increased alkaline phosphatase (396 U/L) and gamma‑glutamyl transferase (263 U/L), with low-normal albumin (3.7 g/dL) and normal total protein, globulin, and A/G ratio, indicating a cholestatic pattern of liver injury.",
  "differential_diagnoses": [
    {
      "name": "Obstructive cholestasis (e.g., biliary obstruction or gallstone disease)",
      "justification": "Conjugated bilirubin markedly elevated with high alkaline phosphatase and GGT suggests extra‑hepatic biliary obstruction."
    },
    {
      "name": "Intrahepatic cholestasis (e.g., drug‑induced or autoimmune)",
      "justification": "Elevated conjugated bilirubin together with high ALP and GGT can occur in intrahepatic cholestasis without clear obstruction."
    },
    {
      "name": "Acute viral or inflammatory hepatitis",
      "justification": "AST and ALT are elevated, though less than ALP, indicating hepatocellular injury that may coexist with cholestasis."
    },
    {
      "name": "Primary biliary cholangitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis",
      "justification": "Cholestatic laboratory profile (high conjugated bilirubin, ALP, GGT) is characteristic of chronic cholestatic liver diseases."
    },
    {
      "name": "Hemolysis",
      "justification": "Mildly elevated unconjugated bilirubin could reflect hemolysis, but lack of anemia data makes this less likely."
